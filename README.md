# ReadMe

## Description
This application will allow someone to explain their projects, what is does, how it works, and any details that are necessary for the end user. 

- Working on this assignment, I was able to create function in the index.js and the generateMarkdown.js in order to allow users to clone this repository and use the framework for an organized Read.me
